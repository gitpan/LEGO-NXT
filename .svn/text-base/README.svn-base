LEGO::NXT
==========================

This module provides low-level control of a LEGO NXT brick over bluetooth
using the Direct Commands API.  This API will not enable you to run programs
on the NXT, rather, it will connect to the NXT and issue real-time commands
that turn on/off motors, retrieve sensor values, play sound, and more.

Users will leverage this API to control the NXT directly from an external box.

This is known to work on Linux. Other platforms are currently untested,
though it should work on any system that has the Net::Bluetooth module.
